## 🧠 Recommendation Logic

This system uses a **hybrid collaborative filtering** approach:
- Collects user’s branch and interest input via UI
- Java-based logic computes similar user profiles and course patterns
- Flask handles routing, communication with the Java module, and renders the recommendations
- Results are shown with dynamic UI cards that allow further interaction

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 🔨 Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Java installed and added to system path
- MySQL server running

---

### ⚙️ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gunashreebh/intelligent-course-recommender.git
cd intelligent-course-recommender
````

2. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up MySQL**

* Create a database named `coursedb`
* Run the script in `database/schema.sql` to create tables and insert base data

4. **Run Flask app**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Compile and run Java logic (in separate terminal)**

```bash
cd recommender-java
javac Main.java
java Main
```

6. **Open in browser**
   Visit: `http://localhost:5000`
